        <h1>Welcome to Simple Design</h1>
        <p>Simple Design is a collaboration tool that makes it possible for business analysts/designers, software developers, and users to share a common repository of business processes and documentation.</p>
        <p>Simple Design brings together business documentation with flow diagrams to provide a full picture of your business processes.</p>
        <p>Simple Design is comprised of three parts: a <b>Catalog</b> to organize your business documentation, <b>Artifacts</b> to house the written documentation of your system, and <b>Diagrams</b>, the graphical picture of your system that ties the artifacts together in a meaningful way.</p>

            <h2>Catalog</h2>
            <p>Configure a category (folder) structure in whatever way works best to describe your business. The catalog can be structured by use cases, functional areas, technical vs user flows, etc.</p>
            <p>All Artifacts and Diagrams will be stored in the Catalog, providing structure and organization to your business knowledge repository.</p>

            <h2>Artifacts</h2>
            <p>Artifacts represent whatever design documents your organization uses, whether they be use cases, business rule documents, page wireframes, technical documents, user desktop procedures, etc. Upload the source documents into the Artifacts library for easy access for all users.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h2>Diagrams</h2>
            <p>Construct flow-chart diagrams to describe whatever your business needs defining. It could be a desktop procedure, a web application page flow, or pseudocode for a program.</p>
            <p>Diagrams can include references to Artifacts uniting all your disparate documentation in a cohesive way.</p>
